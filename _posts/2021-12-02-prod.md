Paper ["The Effect of People Recommenders on Echo Chambers and Polarization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00626) preprint is out on arXiv.
Joint work with Federico Cinus, Corrado Monti and Francesco Bonchi from ISI Foundation.

This paper aims to provide a systematic and robust framework to assess the net contribution of people-recommender algorithms to the opinion dynamics.
The current debate on which is the role of online social networks in the polarization of occidental societies has attracted the attention of both scholars, politicians \[1\], and public opinion \[2\].

People recommenders are at the core of services such as Twitter 'Who To Follow', Facebook 'People You May Know', etc. and are of special interest, as they directly contribute to the evolution of the social network structure, affecting the information and the opinions users are exposed to.

For researchers outside social media companies, it is almost impossible to put up a real-world experiment (i.e.: sort of A/B test) to quantify the influence of a recommender, all else being equal. And even for them, online experiments are quite unappealing since there is a high risk of hurting the user experience.

These are the main reasons that have driven our efforts to devise a synthetic - but still robust and realistic - framework to measure the effect of people recommenders.

The first ingredient of this work is the random network model. We have adapted the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark \[3\] to generate synthetic social graphs with a tunable amount of _initial homophily_ and _modularity_. The realistic properties of this procedure are established in the original work \[3\].
