Paper ["The Effect of People Recommenders on Echo Chambers and Polarization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00626) preprint is out on arXiv.
Joint work with Federico Cinus, Corrado Monti and Francesco Bonchi from ISI Foundation.

This paper aims to provide a systematic and robust framework to assess the net contribution of people-recommender algorithms to the opinion dynamics.
The current debate on which is the role of online social networks in the polarization of occidental societies has attracted the attention of both scholars, politicians \[1\], and public opinion \[2\].

People recommenders are at the core of services such as Twitter 'Who To Follow', Facebook 'People You May Know', etc. and are of special interest, as they directly contribute to the evolution of the social network structure, affecting the information and the opinions users are exposed to.

For researchers outside social media companies, it is almost impossible to put up a real-world experiment (i.e.: sort of A/B test) to quantify the influence of a recommender, all else being equal. And even for them, online experiments are quite unappealing since there is a high risk of hurting the user experience.

These are the main reasons that have driven our efforts to devise a synthetic - but still robust and realistic - framework to measure the effect of people recommenders.

The first ingredient of this work is the random network model. We have adapted the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark \[3\] to generate synthetic social graphs with a tunable amount of _initial homophily_ and _modularity_. The realistic properties of this procedure are established in the original work \[3\].

Second, the procedure which allows to transparently plugin whatever recommender and opinion-dynamics model and assess the long-term consequences in terms of network structure and opinions.

| For a number of timesteps $$T_{max}$$, nodes are visited se- quentially in random order (lines 3-5). At each time step, every node interacts with $S$ other nodes, according to the update rule of the opinion dynamics model. There are two ways interactions can happen: through newly created links (lines 10-19) or through pre-existing links (lines 20-23). In the former case, the ODM and the link recommender work jointly, while the latter case is a typical step of an ODM. |

An important remark is that we have considered the concept of  _attention budget_: since time and attention are limited resources, users interact with a small set of neighbors \[4\], even if nominally they declare a larger number of friends on social media. Thus, we paired the emergence of a new connection due to the recommender with the deletion of a pre-existing connection implementing a _rewiring mechanism_ (lines 12-13). This also allows us to delimit the dynamics to the recommender effect rather than to the density increment caused by adding new edges.
